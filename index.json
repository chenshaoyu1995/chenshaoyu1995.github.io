Unlike video/audio streaming where the content is usually consumed sequentially, 3D applications such as gaming require streaming 3D assets to facilitate client-side interactions such as object manipulation and viewpoint movement. Compared to audio and video streaming, 3D streaming often requires larger data sizes and yet lower latency to ensure sufficient rendering quality, resolution, and latency for perceptual comfort. Thus, streaming 3D assets can be even more challenging than streaming audios/videos, and existing solutions often suffer from long loading time or limited quality. To address this critical and timely issue, we propose a perceptually-optimized progressive 3D streaming method for spatial quality and temporal consistency in immersive interactions. Based on the human visual mechanisms in the frequency domain, our model selects and schedules the streaming dataset for optimal spatial-temporal quality. We also train a neural network for our model to accelerate this decision process for real-time client-server applications. We evaluate our method via subjective studies and objective analysis under varying network conditions (from 3G to 5G) and client devices (HMD and traditional displays), and demonstrate better visual quality and temporal consistency than alternative solutions.","tags":[],"title":"Instant Reality: Gaze-Contingent Perceptual Optimization for 3D Virtual Reality Streaming","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shaoyu Chen","Fabio Miranda","Nivan Ferreira","Marcos Lage","Harish Doraiswamy","Corinne Brenner","Connor Defanti","Michael Koutsoubis","Luc Wilson","Ken Perlin","Claudio Silva"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1627257600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1627257600,"objectID":"677f2209a304b70f294d70a33d31c0aa","permalink":"https://chenshaoyu1995.github.io/publication/urbanrama/","publishdate":"2021-07-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/urbanrama/","section":"publication","summary":"Exploring large virtual environments, such as cities, is a central task in several domains, such as gaming and urban planning. VR systems can greatly help this task by providing an immersive experience; however, a common issue with viewing and navigating a city in the traditional sense is that users can either obtain a local or a global view, but not both at the same time, requiring them to continuously switch between perspectives, losing context and distracting them from their analysis. In this paper, our goal is to allow users to navigate to points of interest without changing perspectives. To accomplish this, we design an intuitive navigation interface that takes advantage of the strong sense of spatial presence provided by VR. We supplement this interface with a perspective that warps the environment, called UrbanRama, based on a cylindrical projection, providing a mix of local and global views. The design of this interface was performed as an interactive process in collaboration with architects and urban planners. We conducted a qualitative and a quantitative pilot user study to evaluate UrbanRama and the results indicate the effectiveness of our system in reducing perspective changes, while ensuring that the warping doesnt affect distance and orientation perception.","tags":[],"title":"UrbanRama: Navigating Cities in Virtual Reality","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mingqian Zhao","Yijia Su","Jian Zhao","Shaoyu Chen","Huamin Qu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1511740800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1511740800,"objectID":"ba2c4d3337c818436e5237b90b7e77d0","permalink":"https://chenshaoyu1995.github.io/publication/mobilesituated/","publishdate":"2017-11-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mobilesituated/","section":"publication","summary":"Situated Analytics has become popular and important with the resurge of Augmented Reality techniques and the prevalence of mobile platforms. However, existing Situated Analytics could only assist in simple visual analytical tasks such as data retrieval, and most visualization systems capable of aiding complex Visual Analytics are only designed for desktops. Thus, there remain lots of open questions about how to adapt desktop visualization systems to mobile platforms. In this paper, we conduct a study to discuss challenges and trade-offs during the process of adapting an existing desktop system to a mobile platform. With a specific example of interest, egoSlider [Wu et al. 2016], a four-view dynamic ego-centric network visualization system is tailored to adapt the iPhone platform. We study how different view management techniques and interactions influence the effectiveness of presenting multi-scale visualizations including Scatterplot and Storyline visualizations. Simultaneously, a novel Main view+Thumbnails interface layout is devised to support smooth linking between multiple views on mobile platforms. We assess the effectiveness of our system through expert interviews with four experts in data visualization.","tags":[],"title":"Mobile Situated Analytics of Ego-centric Network Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Abishek Puri","Dongyu Liu","Shaoyu Chen","Siwei Fu","Tianyu Wang","Yeukyin Chan","Huamin Qu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1445731200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1445731200,"objectID":"55d3cc4660767b55c398862f98f98ae4","permalink":"https://chenshaoyu1995.github.io/publication/parkvis/","publishdate":"2015-12-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/parkvis/","section":"publication","summary":"We propose ParkVis, a visual analytic system for tracking the unusual patterns of all paying park visitors.
